# Always On Availability Groups

This repo is a collection of T-SQL scripts designed to monitor certain aspects of 
Always On Availability Groups.

The AG Object Synchronization .sql file is code that came from Tom Willwerth while 
he was a consultant at StraightPathSQL.

The "AG Performance Dashboard.sql" file was sourced from 
https://sqlperformance.com/2015/08/monitoring/availability-group-replica-sync with some changes by me.

The idea of the canary table and how it is set up to monitor AGs is from Brent Ozar.

The "Reseatch Queries.sql" files is a collection of queries I use to see what information is 
Available from sys.dm_os_performance_counters.
